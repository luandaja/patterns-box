# Specification

## ✅Goal

* Convert the interface of one class into another interface clients expect.
* Allow classes to work together that couldn't otherwise due to imcompatible interfaces.
* Future-proof client implementations by having them depend on Adapter interfaces, rather than concrete classes directly.

## 🏛Architecture

{% hint style="info" %}
\[If needed add notes here\]
{% endhint %}

\[Insert an image to describe the expected architecture\]

## 🌎Real case example

\[Describe your case\]

\[Add an image to support your text\]

## ☢What problems does it solve?

* \[Use a bullet list to describe the problems\]

## ⏲When to use it?

* A library that would be helpful to your application does not implement the interface you require.
* Your are designing a library or a framework and you want to ensure it can be used by classes not yet created.
* You need to use several existing subclasses, but it's impractical to adapt their interface by subclassing every one.

## ⚠When not to use it?

\[Describe conditions to avoid them\]

{% hint style="warning" %}
\[Use warning hints to clarify ambiguous cases\]
