Bridge Pattern is a structural design pattern that divides business logic or huge class into separate class hierarchies that can be developed independently.

# Bridge

## ‚úÖGoal

"Decoupling an abstraction from its implementation so that both can vary independently."

## üåéReal case example

\[Describe your case\]

## üèõArchitecture

The participants of this patterns would be:

* The **Abstraction** defines an interface and maintains a reference to an Implementor.
* The **RefinedAbstraction** extends the interface defined by the Abstraction. 
* The **Implementor** defines the interface for implementation classes. Typically the Implementation interface provides only primitive operations, and Abstraction defines higher-level operations based on these primitives.
* The **ConcreteImplementor** objects implement the Implementor interface.

Let's consider the example we saw in the previous point. Having in mind the dimensions mentioned, we could apply the pattern the following way:

* The _**Payment Method**_ would the our _**Abstraction**_ so it could expose a DoPayment\(\) method.
* The _**Deposits**_, _**Checks**_, etc would be our _**Refined Abstractions**_. They would implement the DoPayment\(\) method in order to make the payment proccess according to their type of payment.
* The _**Bonos**_ would be the _**Implementation**_ that will expose a GetRemuneration\(\) method.
* Finally, the _**Achieved Goals**_, _**Extra Hours**_, etc would be the _**Concrete Implementations**_ that will have to implement the GetRemuneration\(\) method to retrieve the amount of money to be paid.
